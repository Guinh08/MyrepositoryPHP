        <ul>
            <li>
                My grandpa fought in World War II
                He was such a noble dude
                I can't even finish school
                Missed my mom, and left too soon
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                His dad was a fireman
                Who fought fires so violent
                I think I bored my therapist
                While playing him my violin
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                that's so insane
                (Oh, my God) that's such a shame
                Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
                But I can't help myself from feeling bad
                I kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The world's smallest violin
                Really needs an audience
                So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)
                I'll blow up into smithereens
                And spew my tiny symphony
                Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                My grandpa fought in World War II
                And he was such a noble dude
                Man, I feel like such a fool
                I got so much left to prove
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                All my friends have vaping friends
                They're so good at making friends
                I'm so scared of caving in
                Is that entertaining y–µt?

            <li>
                Somewhere in the universe
                Somewhere someone's got it worse
                Wish that made it easier
                Wish I didn't feel the hurt
            </li>

                And spew my tiny symphony
                All up and down a city street
                While tryna put my mind at ease
                Like finishing this melody
                This feels like a necessity
                So this could be the death of me
                Or maybe just a better me
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Now, come in with the timpanis
                And take a shot of Hennessy
                I know I'm not there mentally
                But you could be the remedy
                So let me play my violin for you
            </li>
            <br>
