                Been about three days and I'm comin' back
                I'm about four minutes from a heart attack
                And I think you make me a maniac
                But you don't know, oh
                Two years and we in between
                But we both been here since we 17
                Here we go, fist fight in a limousine
                But they don't know
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                And we both hope there's something
                But we bo-both keep fronting
                And it's a closed discussion
                And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk" (oh-oh-oh)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Well, they'd be like (oh-oh-oh)
                "Shit is crazy, right?" (Oh-oh-oh)
                I ain't your baby no more
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Been about two weeks since you went away
                I'm about halfway through a Cabernet
                There I go, I'm wastin' a Saturday
                Sittin' at home
                Told my new roommate not to let you in
                But you're so damn good with a bobby pin
                Now you gon' play me like a violin
                Hittin' these notes
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                And we both hope there's something

                And I'm thinking, "Damn, if these walls could talk" (oh-oh-oh)
