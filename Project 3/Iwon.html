                Medals 'round my neck because I won, I won (won, I won)
                Now my mama set 'cause I won, I won (won, I won)
                Out here making bands, do what I want (what I want)
                Greedy with the phone, I get what I want (what I want)
                Skrrt the Hidden Hills up to 101 (101)
                She just wanna chill on some one-on-one (one-on-one)
                I just hit the gas, bitch, I'm gone, I'm gone (gone)
                I might do the dash on 'em, just because (woo, yeah)
                Medals 'round my neck because I w-w-won

                And I'm not gon' stop winning
                And I'm not gon' stop spending
                Lifestyle, I'm locked in it
                Ten weeks, I've been top ten-ing
                She need me like oxygen
                Felt the same 'til I got finished
                Big ring with them rocks in it (ah)
                When I pop one, I'm like Popeye when he got spinach
                I'm clean cut with a pop image
                But it's demons that I'm locked in with (yeah)
                Take a flight and switch continents
                My old whip ain't have an AUX in it (brr)
                New whip, I just hit a button, then suddenly there's no top in it (no top in it)
                But I still get plenty in it, then I give her that Jimi Hendrix
                Lusted over by plenty women, say I look just like Diggy Simmons
                Fresh Prince, I get Jiggy with it
                Lotta hits, it's never any misses
                Dizzy Whizz, I'm in the city with it
                On top, any minute (any minute)

                Pulled up in that full truck, made it drop-down like her skrrt, skrrt
                Lames talking that bullshit, well that bullshit ain't gon' work, work
                New crib got a good view, bring the hood through what I could do
                Lil' baby, she know that I'm worth it, can't tell me that I don't deserve (ayy)
                Billion bucks if you want this deluxe
                Baby, I feel expensive, okay
                Yeah, I came from the cut and I ran that shit up
                Just to spend it and splurge with the gang
                Watch me not give a fuck 'cause it's up, and it's stuck
                Baby, I'm never going away
                Feel like AI when I hit the stage
                Never practice, but I came to play
