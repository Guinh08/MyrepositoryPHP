                I don't really wanna go
                I don't really wanna stay
                But I really hope and pray
                Can we get it together?
                Get it together
                Mustard on the beat, hoe

                I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
                I trap until the, bloody bottoms is underneath
                'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
                I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
                I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
                Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
                I was wakin' up gettin' racks in the mornin'
                I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
                Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
                If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
                I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
                But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
                I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
                I hop inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
                These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
            </li>

                I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
                I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
